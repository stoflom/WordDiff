    <b>Text1:</b> &nbsp Plants acaulescent, with leaves in a basal rosette about 8 cm diam., proliferous from the base and forming small clusters. Leaves about 50, the young erect, incurved at the tips, the old ascending, somewhat spreading, with tips incurved, about 27 mm long, 9 mm broad, up to 5 mm thick, elongate or ovate-elongate, blue-green; upper surface flat to rounded, semi-pellucid, with 5 to 7 indistinct reticulate lines, smooth; lower surface convex, smooth, not pellucid; keel 1, often 2, centrally positioned in the upper half, the second one when present usually towards the margin, dentate; margins acute with a whitish edge visible from about the middle to the base, smooth, or with 0.5 mm long pellucid teeth; end-awn about 7 mm long, white, smooth. Inflorescence about 15 cm tall; peduncle simple, terete, about 2 mm diam., 8 cm long, bracteate; sterile bracts membranous, ovate, about 4 mm long, erect, keeled; raceme about 7 cm long, lax, with about 20 spirally arranged flowers and buds, 3 to 4 open simultaneously; floral bracts membranous, 5 mm long, deltoid, acute, keeled with reddish-brown veins, clasping the pedicels, (longer than the pedicels); pedicels 2 mm long, 1 mm diam., green, erect; perianth with brownish-green keels to the segments, 14 mm long, curved, compressed at base, funnel-shaped, segments free to the base, limb 2 lipped; posterior segments little recurved, pinkish-white, spreading, with brown veins; exterior part strongly recurved, spreading, pinkish-white with light brown veins; stamens 6 of two lengths, 8 and 9 mm long, inserted within the perianth tube; ovary 4 mm long, 2 mm diam., green; style 1 mm long, straight, white, capitate.<br><br>
