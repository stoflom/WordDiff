//Function to detect insertions and deletions between two texts
//and to markup the differences with html/other tags.

//Original idea from: https://github.com/dj-nitehawk/DiffWords.git
//This is a new implementation with a different algorithm.

//It is assumed a nearby same word is a match, and the rest are insertions or deletions.
//This limits the algorithm to short texts with a small number of differences,
//where this assumption is likely to be true.
//It is intended for highlighting short diffences in database entries, not for comparing long texts.
//If the text contains multiple occurrences of the same word, the algorithm may not work as expected.
